This project autocompletes a term after reading in data. Given the beginning of a term (like "To"), it would find the match with the largest weight (in a file such as cities.txt) and return the best autocompleted match. 
This can be used in tandem with the synonyms.py is "esc180" read in code to find the weighting of terms in a file.
