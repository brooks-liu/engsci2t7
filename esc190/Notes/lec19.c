// for linked list remove and insert see the lab
//linked lists run in O(n) if you try to get to an index, while arrays are O(1)
// to remove an element, linked lists are O(1) if we know where we are, while for arrays you have to shift everything so O(n)
// to insert its the same as above
// note that you have to be there in the linked lists in order to do this
// get might be O(1) in this case as well
//linked lists are not fixed size
